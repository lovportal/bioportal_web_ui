    content_negotiation:
      content: Content negotiation in the context of the Semantic Web refers to the
        mechanism by which two communicating parties, such as a client and a server,
        agree on the most suitable representation of a resource during the process
        of dereferencing a URI or IRI. In other words, when a client requests a resource
        by dereferencing a URI, it indicates its preferences for the format of the
        response data through HTTP headers or other negotiation mechanisms. The server,
        in turn, examines these preferences and selects the most appropriate representation
        of the resource based on what is available.
      title: Content negotiation
    format_not_specified: Format not specified
    how_it_works:
      content_1: |
        The check resolvability tool allows you to test if a given URL is resolvable. It is based on the HTTP HEAD method.
        We check the resolvability of a URL by sending a HEAD request to the URL and checking if the response status code is 200 (OK) and
        the returned content type is equal to one of the following %{resolvability_formats}.
      content_2: |
        We have a timeout set to %{resolvability_timeout} seconds, so if the URL is not resolvable within that time, the check will fail.
        And a max redirections set to %{resolvability_max_redirections}, so if the URL is not resolvable within that number of redirections, the check will fail.
      title: How it works
    resolving_uri:
      content: |
        In the context of web semantics, dereferencing refers to the process of resolving and obtaining the actual data associated with a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). In simpler terms, it involves following a link represented by a URI/IRI to retrieve information or resources linked to that identifier.
        In the Semantic Web, URIs are used to uniquely identify resources, and dereferencing allows systems to access and retrieve data related to those resources. When a URI/IRI is dereferenced, it typically leads to the retrieval of RDF (Resource Description Framework) data or other structured information that describes the resource in a machine-readable format. This enables systems to understand and process the meaning of the linked data, facilitating the exchange and integration of information on the web.

      LovPortal is the gateway for publishing and sharing, in a FAIR manner, semantic vocabularies (or another type of semantic artefact, ontology, terminology, thesaurus, ...). LovPortal is specifically targets domain-agnostic vocabularies.

      However, LovPortal is currently not a direct upload platform. It is an OntoPortal-based instance of the Linked Open Vocabularies (LOV) platform. It mirrors the content curated and published through LOV, which remains the sole source of vocabularies for LovPortal at this time.

      If you wish to make your vocabulary available on LovPortal, you must first submit it to LOV following their guideline and curation process. Note that if your vocabulary is within a discipline explicitly covered by a domain-specific ontology repository of the OntoPortal Alliance, it might be redirected there rather than in LovPortal.
    ontoportal_description: The OntoPortal Alliance %{ontoportal_link} is a consortium
      of research and infrastructure teams dedicated to promoting the development
      of vocabulary repositories and semantic artefact catalogues based on the open,
      collaboratively developed OntoPortal software %{github_link}. Hereafter are
      the current public and open repositories built with the technology maintained
      by the Alliance.

    slices_description: Slices allow users to interact (both via API or UI) only with
      a subset of vocabularies in AgroPortal. If browsing the slice, all the portal
      features will be restricted to the chosen subset, enabling users to focus on
      their specific use cases. On AgroPortal, slices and groups are synchronized,
      so every group has a corresponding slice displaying only the vocabularies from
      that group.
